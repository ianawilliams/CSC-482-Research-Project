I have included the all the files for running the version of FUIGUI you emailed to me earlier in the semester. I did not include the rating system program because it was explained in the final report and the actual code had nothing to do with the research as it was merely a loop that wrote integers to a file. \
\
The only file that has been modified from the original files you sent me besides the command files is assign_penalty.c in folder 2. \
\
I have placed my final report in the main folder in both pdf and word document format. \
\
There is a file in each folder except for the fifth one all called variations of run_<name>_com. They will automatically complete compilation steps. They are all formatted to run on the linux computers in the ECS labs. If you run the program you will need to make sure the output files are the correct name for your system. The C executable files are all called "./a.out" by default. \
\
To run the program including my modified score function you will need to open run_compile_com and change the directory path names that the files changing the part before "/fullerene_pictures/" to suit your system. \
\
To run FUIGUI after changing those documents simply change the current directory to /fullerene_pictures/  and run the run_compile_com file and the FUIGUI window will automatically open. }
